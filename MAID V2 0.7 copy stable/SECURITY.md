# MAID V2 - Security Documentation

## Security Audit Summary

This extension has been audited for security vulnerabilities and implements industry-standard security practices.

### ‚úÖ Security Features Implemented

#### 1. **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Protection**
- All user input is sanitized using the `escapeHtml()` function before rendering
- Template literals properly escape HTML entities: `&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`
- Uses `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` for dynamic content
- No unsafe DOM manipulation methods used

#### 2. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
- Strict CSP configured in manifest.json:
  - `script-src 'self'` - Only scripts from the extension are allowed
  - `object-src 'self'` - Only objects from the extension are allowed
  - No inline scripts permitted
  - No `eval()` or unsafe-eval allowed

#### 3. **Safe Data Storage**
- Uses `chrome.storage.local` API (sandboxed per extension)
- No sensitive data (passwords, tokens) stored
- Only stores user preferences: URL patterns and folder names
- No external data transmission

#### 4. **Input Validation**
- URL and folder name inputs are validated before storage
- Empty values are rejected with error messages
- Duplicate URL checks prevent conflicts
- All inputs are trimmed and sanitized

#### 5. **No Code Injection Vectors**
- No use of `eval()`, `Function()` constructor, or `setTimeout/setInterval` with strings
- No external script loading
- No dynamic script generation
- No postMessage to untrusted origins

### üìã Permissions Explanation

#### Required Permissions:
1. **`downloads`** - Required to intercept and modify download file paths
2. **`storage`** - Required to save user filter preferences
3. **`tabs`** - Required to open the options page when extension icon is clicked

#### Host Permissions:
- **`*://*/*`** (All URLs) - Required because:
  - The extension needs to check download URLs against user-defined filters
  - Chrome's downloads API requires host permissions to access download URL information
  - Without this, the extension cannot determine where files are being downloaded from
  - This permission does NOT inject content scripts or access page content
  - It's only used for reading download metadata

### üîí Privacy Guarantees

1. **No Data Collection**: Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any user data
2. **No Analytics**: No tracking, analytics, or telemetry code
3. **No External Requests**: Extension does not make any external HTTP requests
4. **Local Only**: All data stays on the user's device in chrome.storage.local
5. **No Third-Party Code**: No external libraries or dependencies

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices Followed

- [x] Manifest V3 compliance (latest security standards)
- [x] Minimal required permissions
- [x] Content Security Policy enabled
- [x] Input sanitization on all user data
- [x] No inline event handlers
- [x] No external resources loaded
- [x] No eval or code generation
- [x] Safe DOM manipulation only
- [x] Clear security documentation

### üîÑ Regular Security Maintenance

To maintain security:
1. Keep extension updated with latest Chrome security standards
2. Review code for new vulnerabilities regularly
3. Monitor Chrome Web Store security requirements
4. Update CSP if new security standards emerge
5. Audit dependencies (currently: none)

### üìù Security Incident Response

If a security issue is discovered:
1. Report via email: aidandj@gmail.com
2. Issue will be triaged within 24 hours
3. Critical issues will be patched immediately
4. Users will be notified of security updates via Chrome Web Store

### ‚úÖ Chrome Web Store Compliance
