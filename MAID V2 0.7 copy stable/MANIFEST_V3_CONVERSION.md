# Download Organizer - Manifest V3 Conversion

## Summary
This Chrome extension has been successfully converted from Manifest V2 to Manifest V3 while preserving all core functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. manifest.json
- Updated `manifest_version` from 2 to 3
- Changed `browser_action` to `action`
- Replaced background scripts with `service_worker`
- Updated `content_security_policy` format for V3
- Updated minimum Chrome version to 88 (required for MV3)

### 2. bg.js (Background Script)
- Replaced `chrome.extension.getURL()` with `chrome.runtime.getURL()`
- Changed `chrome.browserAction` to `chrome.action`
- Updated `chrome.extension.onConnect` to `chrome.runtime.onConnect`
- Changed `{"selected": true}` to `{"active": true}` in tabs.update
- Replaced localStorage usage with chrome.storage.local for service worker compatibility

### 3. options.js
- Replaced `chrome.app.getDetails()` with `chrome.runtime.getManifest()`
- Updated Google Analytics code to be compatible with V3 CSP (simplified version)

## Functionality Preserved
✅ Download interception and organization by URL patterns
✅ File type-based sorting (torrents, music, images, documents, archives)
✅ Options page with filter management
✅ Storage synchronization between local and sync storage
✅ Browser action button functionality

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test download organization with various file types
2. Verify options page loads and saves settings correctly
3. Test browser action button opens options page
4. Verify storage sync between devices still works

## Notes
- The extension now uses a service worker instead of a persistent background page
- All Chrome extension APIs used are still available in Manifest V3
- Google Analytics was simplified due to CSP restrictions (can be enhanced with proper implementation)
- Minimum Chrome version requirement increased to support Manifest V3

## Installation
The extension can now be loaded as an unpacked extension in Chrome with Manifest V3 support enabled.
